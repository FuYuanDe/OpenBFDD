   * Improved low memory handling. There is now, at least, a good chance  
     that existing sessions will continue to stay up in low memory 
     situations. Memory failures during setup of bfdd-beacon will still 
     crash, since there is no real damage that can be done at that point.

   * Fixed small bug where a "select" error due to interrupt could 
     permanently disable a bfdd-command communications port in 
     bfdd-beacon.
