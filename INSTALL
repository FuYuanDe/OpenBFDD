Installation Instructions For OpenBFDD
*************************

=====================
+ Basic Installation From Distribution Package
=====================
                                     
If you are building OpenBFDD from a distribution package, the following 
should build and install the package if run from the directory containing 
the package source code:

   ./configure ; make ; make install

This will builds and install bfdd-beacon, bfdd-control and the manpages 
for both of these. 

====================
+ Compiling For Your Operating System 
====================

OpenBFDD may not build, without modification, on all operating systems. 
See the README file for a list of tested operating systems. If your system
s not included, then we encourage you to make the modifications necessary 
and submit them to http://github.com/dyninc/OpenBFDD for inclusion in future releases.

=====================
+ Configuration Options
=====================

The standard configuration options are available. Run `./configure --help'
or a list of these.
   
In addition the --enable-debug optional will enable additional runtime 
checking and asserts. Be aware that, by default, these asserts will halt 
execution of the bfdd-beacon. This build is for testing only and is not 
recommended for production systems. 

=====================
+ Setup From Source Repository
=====================

If you are not using a supplied ditribution package, but instead, are 
working directly with the sources from the open source repository, then 
you should have the DEVELOPERS document in your sources. See this document
or more information on building from the source repository.
