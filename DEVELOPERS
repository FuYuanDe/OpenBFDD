Developing the OpenBFDD Project
*************************

This document is intended for those wishing to work on the OpenBFDD 
project instead of dimply building and running a supplied distribution 
package.
 
Development information and support can be found at http://github.com/dyninc/OpenBFDD/.

=====================
+ Setup From Source Repository
=====================

If you are not using a supplied distribution package, but instead, are 
working directly with the sources from the open source repository, then it
ill be necessary to have the GNU Autotools installed (automake, autoconf, 
etc.). 

The code was originally setup using automake-1.11 and autoconf-2.62, but 
it may be possible to use other versions. If you are using a version of 
automake prior to 1.11 then the --enable-silent-rules ./configure option 
will not be available. 
      
Running `./autogen.sh' should create the support files necessary to build 
and install as described in the INSTALL document.


=====================
+ Configuration Options For Development
=====================

The standard configuration options are available. Run `./configure --help'
or a list of these.
   
In addition the --enable-debug optional will enable additional runtime 
checking and asserts. Be aware that, by default, these asserts will halt 
execution of the bfdd-beacon. This build is for testing only and is not 
recommended for production systems.  For development, the following is 
recommended to disable code optimization and ensure the program can be 
easily debugged:

 ./configure --enable-debug CXXFLAGS='-g -O0' 


=====================
+ Creating a Distribution Package
========================

Once the project has been setup, you can create a distribution package 
that can be used as described in the INSTALL document, using the command 
`make dist'.
